A simple but very much outdated demo app which combines the following technologies:

- [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/),
- [Express](http://expressjs.com/),
- [Jade](https://github.com/visionmedia/jade),
- [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and
- [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) \(via the [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/developmentseed/node-sqlite3) module\)
